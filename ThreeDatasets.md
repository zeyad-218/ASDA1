2- Second Dataset (F1) üèéÔ∏è

Why did you choose it:
I chose this dataset because I watch F1 races, love cars, and dream of attending a Grand Prix, making F1 data exciting and motivating to explore.

Description:

Formula 1 racing is one of the most challenging and unpredictable motorsports in the world. While everyone focuses on who wins, understanding why drivers Did Not Finish (DNF) provides crucial insights into reliability, performance, and risk factors in racing. A DNF occurs when a driver is unable to complete a race due to mechanical failures, accidents, disqualifications, or other issues.
This dataset contains comprehensive historical Formula 1 race data specifically curated for predicting DNF outcomes. It combines race results with driver performance, constructor reliability, circuit characteristics, and status information spanning over seven decades of F1 racing history.
