Hello! My name is Zeyad Kassem, and I’m from Egypt 🇪🇬. I graduated with a bachelor’s degree in Industrial Engineering 🎓 from Egypt–Japan University in March 2025.

During my internship at Procter & Gamble 🏭 in Supply Chain Management & Analytics 📊, I discovered the power of data science in optimizing supply chains, it was my first hands-on experience in supply chain data science, and it fascinated me.

This experience inspired me to dive deeper, and now I’m eager to pursue a Master’s in Management and Data Science at Leuphana University to build a career at the intersection of supply chain management and data science 🌐.
